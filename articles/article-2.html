      <h1>Why are we still being silenced? (LGBTQ+ in Lithuania)</h1>
       <p>In Lithuania, just like in many other countries, being a member of the LGBTQ+ community still seems to be a crime. Although it’s not illegal here (that would be even worse), members of the community still can’t express themselves freely without being judged and LGBTQ+ marriages are still not allowed. The question is: what are we still waiting for?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Laisvės Partija (engl. Freedom Party), one of the main parties in our government since the 2020 election, is striving to legalize gay marriage, however, it seems to be impossible right now. A voting for this particular issue happened a while ago, and it was declined because of overbalance of votes against this law. Only two more votes were needed for success. Unfortunately, Lithuanian politicians seem to be stuck in the past, therefore, LGBTQ+ community is still fighting for basic rights.
<br>
<br>The situation isn’t better when it comes to trans people. The transition is very hard to reach and is incredibly expensive, so not everyone can allow themselves to go through with it. Even though World Health Organisation has already removed “transsexuality “from its list of illnesses, it is still seen as a mental health problem in Lithuania. Until 2020, people with such diagnosis couldn’t have some jobs, and to this day they’re not allowed to become custodians or adopt a child. Isn’t that crazy?
<br>
<br>On the other hand, it’s not exactly like it was, for instance, 20 years ago, and my belief is that when thinking of such difficult topics, we should remind ourselves how much we have already achieved. On February 1st of 2021, a law was passed which allows trans people to change their name and surname without having to go to the court. Another thing worth highlighting is organizations that unite LGBTQ+ people, such as „Trans autonomija“ (engl. “Trans autonomy “) or „Arcus“ (engl. “Arc “. What is more, Lithuanian Gabrielė Bernotaitė (Instagram: @lgbtq.vestuves) organizes LGBTQ+ weddings in foreign countries, and she claims to only work with DJ’s, restaurants and hotels that support LGBTQ+ community.
<br>
<br>Finally, I could not be more grateful for the fact that Pride Marches are allowed in Lithuania. Already a few of them took place in the past and there are plans to make more. While some (especially older generations) question why such things are needed, we proudly raise our colourful flags and loudly shout our thoughts for the world to hear us. Pride Marches are a beautiful occasion that connects people and brings everyone closer to the bright future. Because there‘s no shame, just pride!
