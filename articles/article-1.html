      <h1>Women's Day Special</h1>
       <p>March 8 is International Women’s Day. For some it means getting flower for their family members, for others it doesn’t mean anything special and there’s a group of people for whom it means protest.
<br>
<br>
<br>A protest’s going to take place on Marh 8[1] in Budapest, Hungary’s capital, because this seems like the perfect occasion to draw attention to all the abuse, assault, and lack of help from the justice system affecting women in this European country.
<br>
<br>            9 years ago, a woman, Erika Renner, was attacked by her former partner out of jealousy. This former partner poured lye to the victim’s genitals, scaring her for life physically as well as mentally. It took over 5 years for this to be brought to justice. This didn’t happen sometime in the “dark past”, this happened in the 21st century. So many other horrible attacks have taken place since, but the worse the crime and bigger the damage, the more media attention a case gets, so this has been a huge topic nationwide.
<br>
<br>            The sad thing is that this case hasn’t prevented other horrible attacks from happening. The police aren’t more prepared to deal with domestic issues and the justice system hasn’t become stricter either. Just weeks ago another horrible attack took place, in which the attacker blinded a woman, Gabriella Lakatos. Now this protest is dedicated to this victim, but not just her. It’s for all the known and unknown victims of gender-based crimes in Hungary.
<br>
<br>            These might sound horrible to read, but could you imagine this being your daily reality and living with the fear of something like this happening to you every day? When European countries like Hungary are preaching about respecting women, their actions often only go as far as the leader of the country gifting flowers to random women on Women’s Day for publicity. As mentioned before, different countries have different issues, some are more visible to the watching eye of international media, others only surface from time to time, but these issues are far from resolved everywhere.
<br>
<br>            So maybe on this International Women’s Day it might be more important to consider calling to action and initiating change in the structure of whole societies rather than men giving women roses and calling it a day.
<br>
<br> 
<br>
<br>[1] Due to the ongoing war in neighboring Ukraine, the organizers decided to reschedule the protest to April 1.
