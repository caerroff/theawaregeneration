                    <h2 class="title">Feminism and what it means to us</h2>
                    <p class="content">There are many topics and issues close to our heart, and we'll get to all of
                        them, but launching this during Women's History Month, we decided to start it off with feminism.




                        There are many misconceptions and untrue stereotypes about what feminism is and what feminists
                        are like, but these are important to debunk. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines feminism as
                        “belief in and advocacy of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes expressed
                        especially through organized activity on behalf of women's rights and interests”. To put it
                        simply, feminists believe that women and men are equal. Equal, not the same as many like to
                        misinterpret it, but equal. This also includes gender-nonconforming and genderfluid folks as
                        well as trans people.

                        The difference in treatment, salary, representation and, in cases, rights changes from country
                        to country, from community to community, but full equality hasn’t yet been achieved. You might
                        notice the differences in healthcare, housing, abuse, education, and many other places.
                        Therefore, we believe that feminism is a super important topic to talk and educate about as well
                        as becoming active change-makers.

                        I’ve been brought up in a family where my parents share household chores, both of them work and
                        they treated me as equal to my brothers. This is what I’ve seen my whole life and what I deem
                        normal, however not every place and not every person is like that. Listening to the stereotypes
                        my grandmas still have, watching documentaries about women being harassed, treated as second
                        class citizens, and seeing all the stories just in Hungary alone gives me a reality check and
                        inspires me to work on a better future for all women. (Anna)

                        Feminism means a lot to me. I started feeling and thinking like a feminist even when I didn’t
                        know that there’s a movement that focus on that. It all started with little things like getting
                        frustrated when boys were asked to carry the chairs in school, or when someone said I was
                        sitting like a boy. I, a little girl, thought to myself: “Why am I treated differenty than
                        boys?” The anger grew as I became older. I saw men, some of them being my relatives, being
                        sexist towards women, not doing the chores at home, telling sexist jokes and being offended when
                        a woman rejects them. I started to do research and learnt that women get paid less and that
                        they’re less likely to get hired due to the fact that they could get pregnant in the future; I
                        learnt that women are more frequent victims of abuse and sexual harassment; I learnt that women
                        are still seen as objects and beautiful throphies for men. But I am so much more than that. We
                        are so much more than that. We are intelligent, curious, imaginative, strong, independent and
                        just as great as men are. My belief is that to prove this to the rest of the world, we must
                        embrace the sisterhood and loudly share our voices. Will you join us on this hard yet amazing
                        journey? (Gabrielė)

                    <h2 class="title">Why are we still being silenced? (LGBTQ+ in Lithuania)</h2>
                    <p class="content">In Lithuania, just like in many other countries, being a member of the LGBTQ+
                        community still seems to be a crime. Although it’s not illegal here (that would be even worse),
                        members of the community still can’t express themselves freely without being judged and LGBTQ+
                        marriages are still not allowed. The question is: what are we still waiting for?



                        Laisvės Partija (engl. Freedom Party), one of the main parties in our government since the 2020
                        election, is striving to legalize gay marriage, however, it seems to be impossible right now. A
                        voting for this particular issue happened a while ago, and it was declined because of
                        overbalance of votes against this law. Only two more votes were needed for success.
                        Unfortunately, Lithuanian politicians seem to be stuck in the past, therefore, LGBTQ+ community
                        is still fighting for basic rights.

                        The situation isn’t better when it comes to trans people. The transition is very hard to reach
                        and is incredibly expensive, so not everyone can allow themselves to go through with it. Even
                        though World Health Organisation has already removed “transsexuality “from its list of
                        illnesses, it is still seen as a mental health problem in Lithuania. Until 2020, people with
                        such diagnosis couldn’t have some jobs, and to this day they’re not allowed to become custodians
                        or adopt a child. Isn’t that crazy?

                        On the other hand, it’s not exactly like it was, for instance, 20 years ago, and my belief is
                        that when thinking of such difficult topics, we should remind ourselves how much we have already
                        achieved. On February 1st of 2021, a law was passed which allows trans people to change their
                        name and surname without having to go to the court. Another thing worth highlighting is
                        organizations that unite LGBTQ+ people, such as „Trans autonomija“ (engl. “Trans autonomy “) or
                        „Arcus“ (engl. “Arc “. What is more, Lithuanian Gabrielė Bernotaitė (Instagram: @lgbtq.vestuves)
                        organizes LGBTQ+ weddings in foreign countries, and she claims to only work with DJ’s,
                        restaurants and hotels that support LGBTQ+ community.

                        Finally, I could not be more grateful for the fact that Pride Marches are allowed in Lithuania.
                        Already a few of them took place in the past and there are plans to make more. While some
                        (especially older generations) question why such things are needed, we proudly raise our
                        colourful flags and loudly shout our thoughts for the world to hear us. Pride Marches are a
                        beautiful occasion that connects people and brings everyone closer to the bright future. Because
                        there‘s no shame, just pride!

                    <h2 class="title">Women's Day Special</h2>
                    <p class="content">March 8 is International Women’s Day. For some it means getting flower for their
                        family members, for others it doesn’t mean anything special and there’s a group of people for
                        whom it means protest.


                        A protest’s going to take place on Marh 8[1] in Budapest, Hungary’s capital, because this seems
                        like the perfect occasion to draw attention to all the abuse, assault, and lack of help from the
                        justice system affecting women in this European country.

                        9 years ago, a woman, Erika Renner, was attacked by her former partner out of jealousy. This
                        former partner poured lye to the victim’s genitals, scaring her for life physically as well as
                        mentally. It took over 5 years for this to be brought to justice. This didn’t happen sometime in
                        the “dark past”, this happened in the 21st century. So many other horrible attacks have taken
                        place since, but the worse the crime and bigger the damage, the more media attention a case
                        gets, so this has been a huge topic nationwide.

                        The sad thing is that this case hasn’t prevented other horrible attacks from happening. The
                        police aren’t more prepared to deal with domestic issues and the justice system hasn’t become
                        stricter either. Just weeks ago another horrible attack took place, in which the attacker
                        blinded a woman, Gabriella Lakatos. Now this protest is dedicated to this victim, but not just
                        her. It’s for all the known and unknown victims of gender-based crimes in Hungary.

                        These might sound horrible to read, but could you imagine this being your daily reality and
                        living with the fear of something like this happening to you every day? When European countries
                        like Hungary are preaching about respecting women, their actions often only go as far as the
                        leader of the country gifting flowers to random women on Women’s Day for publicity. As mentioned
                        before, different countries have different issues, some are more visible to the watching eye of
                        international media, others only surface from time to time, but these issues are far from
                        resolved everywhere.

                        So maybe on this International Women’s Day it might be more important to consider calling to
                        action and initiating change in the structure of whole societies rather than men giving women
                        roses and calling it a day.



                        [1] Due to the ongoing war in neighboring Ukraine, the organizers decided to reschedule the
                        protest to April 1.
